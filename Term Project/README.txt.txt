Hey There! 
To play CupHead: The Devil's Wife, you will need to have all of the contents in this folder named the way they are. Also, you will need to download python and pygame. Also, it is
important to recognize that the art used in my game is not mine and all credit goes to the respective artists. Here is a link to download python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
and here is one to download pygame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
I hope you enjoy the game I spent countless hours making :). Remember to read the instructions carefully!
